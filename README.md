# Cover Letter Generator

## Description

The Cover Letter Generator is a Python program designed to streamline the process of creating cover letters by automating the generation of these documents based on company details provided in a `.csv` file. This tool is particularly useful for job seekers who need to create multiple cover letters tailored to different companies efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Cover Letter Generation**: For each row in the provided `.csv` file, the program generates a personalized cover letter.
- **Efficiency**: The program eliminates repetitive tasks such as creating new files based on a template in word processors and manually typing or pasting company-specific information.
- **CSV Input**: Users can input company details in a simple `.csv` file, allowing for bulk generation of cover letters.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the CSV File**:
   - Create a `.csv` file with the following columns: `Company Name`, `Company Address`, `Job Title`, `Job Description`, and any other details you want to include in the cover letter.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the Python script. For each row in the `.csv` file, a cover letter will be generated using the provided details.

3. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Although the program generates the cover letters, it is recommended to manually review and adjust each letter to ensure it makes sense and effectively communicates why you are a good fit for the position.

## Installation

To run the Cover Letter Generator, you need Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
